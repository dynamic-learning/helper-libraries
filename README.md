# Helper libraries
During the creation of interactive visualization projects, we might have to write pieces of code that can be used across other projects. This repository is for compiling such pieces of code as libraries.

## How to create a library of your own and  add
Create a copy of the folder [typescript-starter](https://github.com/dynamic-learning/helper-libraries/tree/main/typescript-starter). The basic setup for creating a library is present in it. Add code for your library and create a PR.
